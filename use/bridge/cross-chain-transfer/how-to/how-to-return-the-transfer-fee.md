# How to return the transfer fee

You can get back about \~5.2 EVER, from the transaction fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can return the commission for the transfer only after it has been completed!
{% endhint %}

First, you need to[ find your transaction](find-my-transaction.md) and go to the **** transfer page.\
Here you need to copy the `transfer address`. Just click on the icon.

Now go to [EVER Wallet](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MUxjK3XWZCxuBwyXzkS/s/vwtaQbYcgICT7ubKSITZ/) (in our case it is an extension) and [send ](https://docs.everwallet.net/manage-assets/sending-and-receiving-tokens)about \~0.1 EVER to the `transfer address` we copied.\
\
Be sure to add the following text in the comment field: _**`te6ccgEBAQEABgAACAVriBQ=`**_\
Then confirm the transaction and wait a little while for EVER to arrive in your wallet:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get Everscale network fees back when you make transfers using [Invisible Bridge](../../concepts/invisible-bridge.md)
{% endhint %}

In this case, the process is practically the same as described above, just send your EVERs, attaching a comment[^1], to the address from the line `Prepare second transfer`:
