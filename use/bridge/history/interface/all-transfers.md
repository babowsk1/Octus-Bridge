# All transfers

The bottom block of the [**History section**](https://app.octusbridge.io/transfers) is **All transfers**.

All recent transfers with Octus Bridge are displayed here.\
All transactions have several columns with information about them:

* Transfer amount in tokens
* Transaction type
* Address and networks of recipient and sender
* Transfer date

In the upper right part of the block, you can enable and configure transaction **search filters** by sender address, date, source and target blockchain, sent token, transaction status and type.
