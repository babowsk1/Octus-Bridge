# My staking balance

The **My Staking Balance** section is designed to deposit and withdraw BRIDGE tokens from your staking balance and receive earned rewards:

The **Stake** window is necessary in order to make a deposit.

The **Redeem** window has two functions:\
&#x20;1\. Claim allows you to pick up an earned reward.\
&#x20;2\. Redeem allows you to pick up the Bridge tokens you have staked.
