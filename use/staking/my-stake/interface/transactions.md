# Transactions

The transaction block displays your transactions in the Octus Bridge staking interface.

Displayed here:

* Transaction type (Deposit, Withdrawal, Reward, Freeze)
* Transaction ID
* Amount in BRIDGE tokens
* Transaction date

For convenience, at the top of the block, you can select the type of transaction you need.
